# Network Monitoring Lab with Nagios

This project simulates a real-world NOC environment by using Nagios to monitor multiple test servers for uptime and performance. It demonstrates how network monitoring tools are configured, alerts are handled, and incidents are logged — a valuable hands-on exercise aligned with CCNA and cybersecurity best practices.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Nagios Core** (monitoring)
- Ubuntu Server
- Shell scripting (optional)
- Simulated servers for testing

## 📊 What It Does
- Tracks server uptime, CPU usage, memory usage, packet loss, and HTTP availability
- Sends alerts based on custom thresholds
- Simulates incident response by documenting resolutions and logs

## 📁 Contents
- `setup_guide.md` – Step-by-step guide to install and configure Nagios
- `nagios_config/` – Example configuration files (hosts, services)
- `alert_examples/` – Screenshots of Nagios alerts
- `remediation_logs/` – Sample incident response reports

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Network health monitoring
- Configuring alerts and thresholds
- Simulating downtime and response
- Using Nagios in a practical lab setting

This is part of my personal learning journey in networking and cybersecurity.
